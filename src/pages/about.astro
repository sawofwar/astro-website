      My name is {identity.firstName} and I am an aspiring {

      I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
      page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
    </p>

    <p>Here are my hobbies:</p>
    <ul>
      {identity.hobbies.map((hobby) => <li>{hobby}</li>)}
    </ul>

    <p>
      This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
      back and see how my journey is going!
