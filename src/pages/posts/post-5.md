## My impressions

The Astro tutorial excited me a great deal. Though I am still learning it, I have been getting more comfortable with Astro. I have been taking notes on everything that I have learned so far — a great way to memorise the new concepts such as dynamic routes, props, and all that.

## Hyperfocusing

I find taking my mind off programming hard, always thinking about it: all the exciting projects that I could make and the ones I wish I could but for which I need to learn something.

## Things I have been up to

Over the past few days I have been working on a new version of my main website but this time built with Astro. The components help a lot in the process because in the past I would do the same thing — building reusable components and importing them into pages — but with vanilla JavaScript. Now life has become so much easier!

A great few days for learning!
