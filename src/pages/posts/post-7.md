## Logging my learning

Over the past few days, I have been trying to write down everything that I have been learning. I hope that this way I can better appreciate my progress. I am prone to taking it for granted. Just a month ago I had no idea what some of the technologies I use these days were.

## OOP

Object-oriented programming was the main item on my list for a long time. Last week I got round to brushing up on my OOP knowlede. Unfortunately, it is not immediately applicable to my projects now, but it is still a crucial skill for any developer. A boring list of what I leaned: constructors, creating prototype objects, setting constructor properties, inheritance, resetting inherited properties, mixins, etc.

I am sure that whoever is reading this will know all of those things about OOP.

## Python

I tinkered with Python a little and built my first web scraper! For that I used the newspaper package and some NLP. Now I can extract news articles from my favourite websites and read them without the distractions of those websites' interfaces.

Very excited about all the possibilities granted by Python. I will definitely be learning more about automating things with Python, but that time will come later. Now I am still focused on vanilla JavaScript and the like.

## Node.JS

Similar to what I wrote about Python, I checked out Node.JS and learned how to write text into files and even built my first API! Great stuff, but I will have to wait a little before I can dive into it.

A great week for learning!
